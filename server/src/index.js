 * connection status during each request.
 *
 * 1. Attempts to connect to the database using the `connectDB` function.
 * 2. Once the database is connected, sets up middleware and routes.
 * 3. Adds a middleware to verify the database connection status on each request.
 * 4. Starts the Express server on the configured port if the connection is successful.
 * 5. If the database connection fails, logs the error and exits the process.
